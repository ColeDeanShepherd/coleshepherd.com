                    <p>Need to live with more intent. Easily get carried away wasting time on the internet.</p>
                    <p>Didn't get as much as I wanted done in this pomodoro. Was researching, and and I kept changing text and styling.</p>
                    <p>Couldn't find background image in time. Email subscriptions aren't functional.</p>

                    <p>Have history of not finishing projects. Hit burst of motivation. Passionate about idea. Want to try time management.</p>
                    <p>Already have domain registered. Already have code related to what I'm doing with "startup", but won't be used for a while.</p>
                    <p>Registered with Heroku. Reorganized existing code, moved it out of the way. Setup example node.js project.</p>
                    <p>Only 1 pomodoro.</p>
